\chapter{Dihadron correlations at eRHIC}
\label{chp:dihadron}
As discussed in Chap.~\ref{chp:saturation}, the dihadron correlation measurement
is a very compelling measurement to study the saturation effect. And there are
several advantages to perform this measurement at an EIC. It is of great
interest to measure dihadron correlations in \eA\ not only because it provides
complementary information to \dA\ or \pA\ but also because it is a unique and
clean means to probe the little known Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams (WW) gluon
distribution. The WW gluon distribution is an important and fundamental
unintegrated gluon distribution (UGD) existing in a lot of processes.

At the same time, to achieve an accurate description of experimental data it is
essential to have theoretical calculations beyond leading order, especially as
the higher-order corrections are known to be sizable. The analysis in this work
accounts for gluon radiation in the calculation of the dihadron cross section
through the inclusion of Sudakov factors. It is one of the most important
corrections computed on one-loop level. This is vital for the comparison between
the theory calculation and the future eRHIC data on dihadron correlations.

In the work of this chapter, based on the most recent theoretical developments in saturation
physics, we perform a detailed study of the feasibility, expected precision, and
physics impact of dihadron correlation measurements on gluon dynamics in the
small $x$ region at a future high-luminosity, high-energy EIC. We will
demonstrate that, at the future eRHIC, it is feasible to perform the discussed
dihadron correlation measurement even with a moderate integrated luminosity of
$\mathcal{L}=1 \, \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. We present results for two lepton-nucleus beam energy
configurations, 10 GeV $\times$ 100 GeV and 20 GeV $\times$ 100 GeV, and compare
the results for proton and gold beams, in which the first number (10 GeV or 20 GeV) denotes the electron energy and the second number (100 GeV) is for proton/nuclei beam energy. We use pseudo-data generated by the Monte
Carlo event generator PYTHIA (as mentioned in Chap.~\ref{chp:MC}) integrated with nuclear PDFs,
geometry and energy loss to obtain a non-saturation baseline. The framework of
Ref.~\cite{Dominguez:2011wm} is used to obtain numerical predictions and to
study the size of the suppression of dihadron correlations in a saturation
formalism. For the sake of clarity, relevant kinematic variables
to be used in the study of dihadron correlations have been shown
in Tab.~\ref{tab:varDef}.

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows: in
Sec.~\ref{sec:dihadrontheory}, we discuss the theoretical framework used for the
prediction of saturation effects in the dihadron correlation measurement. We
illustrate our simulation work based on a non-saturation Monte Carlo model in
Sec.~\ref{sec:dihadron_nonsat_mc} and the results in the following sections.
Finally, we summarize and conclude in Sec.~\ref{sec:dihadronsummary}.




\section{Dihadron correlations in the saturation formalism}\label{sec:dihadrontheory}

According to the effective small-$x$ $k_T$ factorization established in
Ref.~\cite{Dominguez:2011wm}, which is briefly summarized above, the
back-to-back correlation limit of the dihadron production cross section can be used
to directly probe the WW gluon distribution $xG^{(1)}(x,q_{\perp})$. As a
comparison, the hadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering
(SIDIS), as shown in Ref.~\cite{Marquet:2009ca}, is related to the so-called
dipole gluon distributions $xG^{(2)}(x,q_{\perp})$.

The coincidence probability $C(\Delta\phi)=\frac{N_{pair}(\Delta\phi)}{N_{trig}}$ is a
commonly exploited observable in dihadron correlation studies, in which
$N_{pair}(\Delta\phi)$ is the yield of the correlated trigger and associate
particle pairs, while $N_{trig}$ is the trigger particle yield. This
correlation function $C(\Delta\phi)$ depends on the azimuthal angle difference $\Delta\phi$
between the trigger and associate particles. In terms of theoretical
calculation, the correlation function is defined as
\begin{eqnarray} 
C(\Delta\phi) 
= & \frac{1}{\frac{d\sigma^{\gamma^{*}+A\rightarrow h_{1}+X}_{\textrm{SIDIS}}}{dz_{h1}}}
\frac{d\sigma^{\gammaA}_{\textrm{tot}}}{dz_{h1}dz_{h2}d\Delta\phi}.
\label{eqn:cdphiCGC} 
\end{eqnarray}

Let us consider a process of a virtual photon scattering on a dense nuclear target
producing two final state back-to-back $q\bar q$ jets:
$\gamma^{*}+A\rightarrow q(k_{1})+\bar{q}(k_{2})+X$, in which $k_1$ and $k_2$ are
the four momenta of the two outgoing quarks. This process is the
dominant one in the low-$x$ region, since the gluon distribution is much larger than
the quark distributions inside a hadron at high energy. The back-to-back correlation
limit indicates that the transverse momentum imbalance is much smaller than each
individual momentum: $q_{\perp}=|k_{1\perp}+k_{2\perp}|\ll P_{\perp}$, with
$P_{\perp}$ defined as $(k_{1\perp}-k_{2\perp})/2$. At leading order (LO), the
dihadron total cross section, which includes both the longitudinal and
transverse contributions, can be written as follows~\cite{Dominguez:2011wm}:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:xspairCGC}
\frac{d\sigma^{\gammaA}_{\textrm{tot}}}{\phase} = & C\int^{1-z_{h2}}_{z_{h1}} dz_{q}
\frac{z_{q}(1-z_{q})}{z^{2}_{h2}z^{2}_{h1}}
d^{2}p_{1\perp}d^{2}p_{2\perp}\mathcal{F}(x_{g},q_{\perp})
\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tot}}(z_{q},k_{1\perp},k_{2\perp})  \nonumber \\
& \times \sum_{q}e^{2}_{q}D_{q}(\frac{z_{h1}}{z_{q}},p_{1\perp})
D_{\bar{q}}(\frac{z_{h2}}{1-z_{q}},p_{2\perp}),
\end{eqnarray}
where $C=\frac{S_{\perp}N_{c}\alpha}{2\pi^{2}}$ gives the normalization
factor, with $S_{\perp}$ being the transverse area of the target, $z_{q}$ is the
longitudinal momentum fraction of the produced quark with respect to the incoming
virtual photon. $D_{q}(\frac{z_{h}}{z_{q}},p_{\perp})$ represents the transverse 
momentum dependent fragmentation functions, where $p_{\perp}$ shows the additional transverse
momentum introduced by fragmentation processes. $\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tot}}$ is the combined hard factor,
$k_{1\perp}$ and $k_{2\perp}$ are the transverse momenta of the two quarks, while
$p_{h1\perp}$ and $p_{h2\perp}$ are the transverse momenta of the two corresponding
produced hadrons, respectively. $\mathcal{F}(x_{g},q_{\perp})$ comes from the
relevant WW gluon distribution $xG^{(1)}(x_g,q_\perp)$ evaluated with the gauge
links for a large nucleus at small $x$ by using the McLerran-Venugopalan
model~\cite{McLerran:1993ni},
\begin{equation} 
\mathcal{F}(x_{g}, q_{\perp}) =
\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}} \int d^{2}r_{\perp} e^{-iq_{\perp}r_{\perp}}
\frac{1}{r^{2}_{\perp}}[1-\exp(-\frac{1}{4}r^{2}_{\perp}Q^{2}_{s})],
\end{equation}
in which $r_{\perp}$ shows the transverse dipole size,  $x_{g}=\frac{z_{q}p_{h1\perp}^2}{z_{h1}^2s}+\frac{(1-z_{q})p_{h2\perp}^2}{z_{h2}^2s}+\frac{Q^2}{s}$ 
is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the small-$x$ gluon with respect to the target hadron and 
$Q_{s}$ is the gluon saturation scale. One gets $xG^{(1)}(x_{g},q_{\perp})=\frac{S_{\perp}}{2\pi^{2}\alpha_{s}}\mathcal{F}(x_{g}, q_{\perp})$.

In principle, the so-called linearly polarised gluon
distribution~\cite{Metz:2011wb,Dominguez:2011br} also contributes to the dihadron
correlation and can be systematically taken into account. This part of the
contribution comes from an averaged quantum interference between a scattering
amplitude and a complex conjugate amplitude with active gluons linearly
polarized in two orthogonal directions in the azimuthal plane. Numerical
calculation shows that this contribution is negligible for dihadron back-to-back
correlations. Also, this type of contribution vanishes when the dihadron correlation function 
is averaged over the azimuthal angle of the trigger particle. 


As to the single-inclusive-hadron production cross section, which enters the
denominator of the definition of the correlation function $C(\Delta\phi)$, it
can be calculated from the saturation physics/CGC formalism~\cite{Marquet:2009ca} as
follows:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:xstrigCGC}
\frac{d\sigma^{\gamma^{*}+A\rightarrow h_{1}+X}_{\textrm{SIDIS}}}{dz_{h1}d^{2}p_{h1\perp}} 
= & C \int^{1}_{z_{h1}}dz_{q} \int
d^{2}q_{\perp} \int d^{2}p_{\perp} F_{x_{g}}(q_{\perp})H_{\textrm{SIDIS}}(k_{\perp},q_{\perp},Q) \nonumber \\ 
  & \times \sum_{q} e^{2}_{q}\frac{z_{q}}{z^{2}_{h1}}D_{q}(\frac{z_{h1}}{z_{q}},p_{\perp}),
\end{eqnarray}
where $H_{\textrm{SIDIS}}$ is the $q_{\perp}$ dependent hard factor for SIDIS,
which includes both the longitudinal and transverse photon contribution. Here
$F_{x_{g}}(q_\perp)$, which is related to $xG^{(2)}(x_g,q_\perp)$ through $xG^{(2)}(x,q_{\perp})=\frac{q^{2}_{\perp}N_{c}S_{\perp}}{2\pi^{2}\alpha_{s}}F_{x_{g}}(q_{\perp})$, is the Fourier
transform of the dipole cross section:
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{x_{g}}(q_{\perp})& = &\int \frac{d^{2}r}{2\pi^{2}}e^{iq_{\perp}\cdot
r_{\perp}} \frac{1}{N_{c}} Tr\langle
U(r_{\perp})U^{\dag}(0)\rangle_{\rho} \nonumber \\ 
& \simeq &\frac{1}{\pi
Q^{2}_{sA}}\exp[-\frac{q_{\perp}^{2}}{Q^{2}_{sA}}], 
\end{eqnarray}
with $U$ being the light-like Wilson line in covariant gauge. 
It has been suggested in Refs~\cite{Dominguez:2011gc, Dumitru:2011vk} that both
dipole and WW gluon distributions have similar geometric scaling behavior.
Therefore, one can parameterize these gluon distributions following the
Golec-Biernat W\"{u}sthoff (GBW)~\cite{GolecBiernat:1998js} model calculation, in
which $Q^{2}_{sA}(x)=c(b)A^{1/3}Q^{2}_{s0}(x/x_{0})^{-\lambda}$, with $Q_{s0}=1$
GeV, $x_{0}=3.04\times 10^{-4}$ and  $\lambda=0.288$. The gluon saturation
momentum is related to $Q^{2}_{sA}(x)$ by
$Q_s^2(x)=\frac{2N_c^2}{N_c^2-1}Q^{2}_{sA}(x)$. $c(b)=c(0)\sqrt{1-b^{2}/R^{2}}$
gives the nuclear profile dependence with a radius $R$, where $b$ is the impact
parameter. As it is not an easy task to determine the exact impact parameter in \eA\
collisions, a median number $c(b)=0.8$ is used for the estimation,
which is supposed to average the nucleus geometry effectively. The parametrized
DSS fragmentation function~\cite{deFlorian:2007aj},
$D(z,p_{\perp})=D(z)\frac{1}{\pi\langle
p^{2}_{\perp}\rangle}e^{\frac{-p_{\perp}^{2}}{\langle p^{2}_{\perp}\rangle}}$ with
$\langle p^{2}_{\perp}\rangle=0.2 \, \mathrm{GeV}^{2}$, is used to compute the hadron
production.

By utilizing Eq.~(\ref{eqn:xspairCGC}) and Eq.~(\ref{eqn:xstrigCGC}), one can
straightforwardly calculate the coincidence probability. The theoretical
prediction at the Born level for the suppression of the away-side of the
dihadron correlation measurement is shown by the solid curves in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadron_theory_sud}.

All the above results are estimated based on the LO Born level
contribution. At the EIC energy scale the one-loop
contribution~\cite{Mueller:2012uf}, which is also known as the so-called Sudakov
factor, can be important as well. To include the Sudakov factor contribution at
leading double logarithm level, one can rewrite the relevant WW distribution as
follows~\cite{Mueller:2013wwa}:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}(x_{g}, q_{\perp}) =
\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}} \int d^{2}r_{\perp} e^{-iq_{\perp}r_{\perp}}
\frac{1}{r^{2}_{\perp}}[1-\exp(-\frac{1}{4}r^{2}_{\perp}Q^{2}_{s})]
\exp[-\frac{\alpha_sN_c}{4\pi}\ln^2\frac{K^2r_{\perp}^2}{c^2_0}],
\label{eqn:Sudakov}
\end{equation}
where $K^2$ represents the hard momentum scale in two-particle production
processes. It can be chosen as $K^2=P^2_{\perp}$ or $K^2=Q^2$, depending on which
one is larger, and $c_0=2e^{-\gamma_E}$ with the Euler constant $\gamma_E$. It
is known that the single logarithmic terms as well as the next-to-leading order
(NLO) contribution of the Sudakov factor also have sizeable contributions 
compared to the above leading double logarithmic contribution. Therefore, the
numerical value of $\alpha_s$ in the Sudakov factor used in this calculation may
be different from what one normally expects according to a QCD running coupling
constant calculation.

One needs to pay attention to the applicability of this calculation.
As the GBW model is not sufficient to describe the UGDs in the region where 
$q_{\perp}$ is much larger than $Q_s$, we should limit this calculation to the
saturation region ($x_g<0.01$) to ensure the GBW model
can be applied. Additionally, to ensure that the power corrections to the
two-particle production are negligible, one needs the magnitude of the jet
transverse momenta $P_{\perp}$ to be much larger than $Q_s$.

The current calculations are performed for $Q^2$ of the same order as
$P^2_{\perp}$. For pair production, the Sudakov factor is usually due to
a scale difference between $P_{\perp}$ and the dijet momentum imbalance $q_{\perp}$.
Because we have required that $P_{\perp}\gg q_{\perp}$ as discussed above, it is
necessary to include the Sudakov contribution.  As for the trigger hadron
inclusive cross section, the Sudakov factor is not important, since the trigger
hadron \pt is of the same order as $Q$ and $P_\perp$. An illustration of
this Sudakov effect with $\alpha_s=0.35$ can be found in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadron_theory_sud} labeled by the dashed lines.
\begin{figure}

\label{fig:dihadron_theory_sud}
}    
\end{figure}
It is worthwhile to point out that the Sudakov effect in a nuclear environment
is still not very well known. In the current small $x$ scenario as shown in
Eq.~(\ref{eqn:Sudakov}), it is convoluted with the gluon distribution function.
The theoretical calculation indicates that the Sudakov factor has no nuclear
$A$ dependence at LO. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadron_theory_sud}, the away-side 
suppression of the dihadron correlation is due to the combination of the
Sudakov suppression and saturation effects. It is conceivable that the
suppression due to saturation effects shall become more and more dominant when
the ion beam species are changed from proton to gold, while the Sudakov effect
remains more or less the same. 

%The kinematic variables are defined
%as $Q^{2}=-q^{2}$, $y=\frac{P\cdot q}{P\cdot k}$, $z_{h}=\frac{P\cdot
%P_{h}}{P\cdot q}$ where $P_{h}, k, P$ and $q$ are the 4-momenta of the final state
%hadron, incoming lepton and nucleon (nucleus) and the exchanged photon. $p_{1T}$ and
%$p_{2T}$ are the transverse momenta with respect to the virtual photon for
%trigger and associate particle, respectively. Accordingly, $z_{1h}$ and $z_{2h}$
%are the $z_{h}$ for trigger/associate particles. 

%\subsection{Connections to \pA\ dihadron correlations}\label{sec:dihadroneAvspA}

Compared to existing \pA\ or \dA\ dihadron correlation data, there are
several advantages to measuring dihadron correlations in \eA\ collisions. 
One valuable feature is that one can make use of the scattered electron to
reconstruct kinematic information event by event. Measuring
the scattered electron allows us to model-independently determine the required
kinematic variables $x$ and $Q^{2}$, which is essential for probing the
underlying gluon dynamics precisely. Another advantage comes from the point-like
structure of electrons. Since electrons have no substructure and they couple to
virtual photons rather weakly, the probability to have multiple emission in \eA\
is very small compared to \pA. This kind of multiple emission or
interaction introduces a significant amount of uncorrelated two-particle production,
which is known as the ``pedestal'' effect in RHIC \dA\ collisions. To understand the
so-called pedestal effect, one needs to take into account the double parton
scattering, which includes two independent and uncorrelated hard scatterings. In
contrast, as explained above, the pedestal contribution should be negligible and
under control in the \eA\ dihadron correlation measurement.

In addition, as is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:eAvspA_kinematics}, the kinematic
coverage of the planned eRHIC realization of the EIC
is very similar to the measured RHIC \dA\ data and
extends to the desired small-$x$ region. Therefore, it will be a more precise and definite
measurement compared with what we have already known from the RHIC \dA\ data.
Here, the RHIC kinematics lines are calculated with the assumption that the major fraction of 
the parton energy is mainly taken by the hadrons, which is not always true.

represent the RHIC coverage at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV for $\eta=0$ and $\eta=4$, where
$\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)$ is the pseudorapidity of the particles.
\label{fig:eAvspA_kinematics}}
\end{figure}

The measurement of dihadron correlations in \eA\ collisions is
interesting by itself. It provides us with a golden opportunity to directly
measure the saturated WW gluon distribution. Through detailed calculations,
Ref.~\cite{Dominguez:2011wm} summarizes the involvement of these two basic
gluon distributions in different observables. It is interesting
to note that the dipole gluon distribution function is involved in most
known processes, especially inclusive DIS measurements, which provides us with a
lot of the essential information of the dipole scattering amplitude. On the
other hand, the WW gluon distribution contributes to only a few of these
processes, thus very little knowledge about the WW distribution exists from
the current experimental data. In addition, unlike the dijet process in \pA,
which receives contribution from both the dipole and WW gluon distribution, the WW gluon
distribution is the only UGD that contributes to \eA\ dijet production. Considering
that the WW gluon distribution can be physically interpreted as the number density
of gluons inside a nuclear wave function, while the dipole gluon distribution
does not have such interpretation, it is important and fundamental to
acquire direct information on the WW gluon distribution through dihadron
correlation measurements at an EIC.



\section{Dihadron correlations in the non-saturation model} \label{sec:dihadron_nonsat_mc}

If one defines $\hat{p}_{T}$ as the transverse momentum
of final state partons in the center of mass system of the hard interaction, the
factorization scale $\mu^{2}$ of $2\rightarrow 2$ processes can be expressed
as $\mu^{2} = \hat{p}_{T}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}Q^{2}$.


To simulate \ep\ events the CTEQ6M~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw} PDF in the
$\overline{\textrm{MS}}$ scheme is used. For the \eA\ event sample, the NLO
EPS09 parton distribution functions \cite{Eskola:2009uj} and hard parton energy
loss based on the medium geometry have been applied to account for nuclear
effects in the simulation. 
The hard parton energy loss in the nuclear medium is included
following the parton quenching model (PQM) formalism based on
Ref.~\cite{Salgado:2003gb}.
In the phenomenological studies of dihadron correlations, triggering on a hadron
with high-$p_T$ on average selects the most energetic hadron in events with 
back-to-back jets. Correlated hadron pairs reflect two important features of QCD 
dynamics of the hard scattering process.
First, an associated hadron at the near-side allows one to probe the in-medium
QCD evolution of an energetic parton, which can be viewed as the final state
effect with the nuclear medium. Second, an associated hadron at the away-side,
in addition to the primary hard scattering, is sensitive to the initial
transverse momentum that the incoming parton carries.

For pQCD calculations in the collinear factorization framework, the PDFs and fragmentation
functions do not contain any transverse momentum dependence. Therefore, the
transverse momentum of hadrons produced in the final state is given by
$p_{T}=z\hat{p}_{T}$, where $\hat{p}_{T}$ and $p_{T}$ are the transverse
momentum of the parton and hadron respectively. $z$ represents the momentum fraction
of a hadron with respect to its mother parton. This relation should be revised
if the transverse momentum is allowed in both the PDFs and fragmentation
functions.

Transverse motion of partons inside hadrons can be effectively included by
assuming that the intrinsic \kt follows a Gaussian distribution. Similarly, the
transverse momentum enhancement  $p_{T}^{\textrm{frag}}$ with respect to the jet
direction during hadronization can also be approximated by a Gaussian
distribution. The \kt and $p_{T}^{\textrm{frag}}$ now
both contribute to the transverse momentum of final state hadrons, which can be
written as $p_{T} =z(k_{T}+\hat{p}_{T})+p_{T}^{\textrm{frag}}$. We follow the
common practice to set the Gaussian width to $0.4$ GeV for both intrinsic $k_{T}$ 
and $p_{T}^{\textrm{frag}}$ distributions in the simulations.

Besides all the above effects, additional soft gluon radiations, normally 
characterized as a parton shower can also modify the final transverse
momentum, thereby impacting the dihadron correlations. In perturbative QCD
calculations the parton shower is computed in terms of Sudakov
form factors.

Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadron_effects} shows an illustration of all the possible
effects available in the Monte Carlo simulation of the azimuthal correlation
function. The open circles illustrate the dihadron correlation with only
intrinsic $k_T$ in the initial parton distribution. It is understandable that the
correlation function is strongly peaked at $\Delta \phi =0, \pi$ for this setting.
Now the other effects are turned on one-by-one according to the order of their
occurrences in physical processes. When the initial state (IS) parton shower
is added into the simulation, as shown by the open diamonds, the away-side
correlation is significantly reduced since it is very sensitive to the momentum
imbalance of the dijet system, while the near-side correlation is almost
unmodified. Next, we turn on the final state (FS) parton shower for the scattered 
parton before the fragmentation process occurs. We find that both the
near-side and away-side peaks are broadened, as illustrated by the empty triangles,
due to soft radiation and particle decay in the fragmentation. 
Lastly, we add transverse momentum dependence into the fragmentation 
function, labeled as $p_T^{\textrm{frag}}$, and obtain the crossings, which indicate further broadening of both peaks.

\label{fig:dihadron_base}}
\end{figure}

For our model of \eA\ implemented in PYTHIA, the effects due to energy loss
in the cold nuclear medium are expected to be weak, because fast moving partons are likely to
fragment outside the nucleus in the considered kinematic regions. Considering
that the nuclear PDF also has little impact on the $p_{T}$ imbalance of dijets,
it comes as no surprise to see very little change from \ep\ to \eA\ in the
simulation, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadron_base}.

\endgroup
Table~\ref{tab:azimuRMS} is a reference for different effects on the relative
root mean square (RMS) deviation of the near/away side azimuthal correlation
function. The RMS deviation is obtained from the $\Delta\phi$ distribution at
each side as
$\Delta\phi_{RMS}=\sqrt{\sum_{i}N_{i}/N(\Delta\phi_{i}-\overline{\Delta\phi})^{2}}$ with
$i$ being the index of every $\Delta\phi$ bin and $\overline{\Delta\phi}=0$
or $\pi$ for near or away side peak; $N_{i}$ shows the counts in $i$th $\Delta\phi$ bin and $N$ gives the total statistics at near or away side. Using the RMS from the correlation function
with all the effects included as the baseline, one can make a ratio by dividing
the RMS that corresponds to each set and get a relative RMS. From this table we
can clearly draw the conclusion that initial-state parton showers dominate the
away-side peak of the correlation function, while the near-side peak is mainly
controlled by final-state effects such as final-state parton showers,
fragmentation \pt and possible resonance decays in the fragmentaion.



\section{Analysis method}

In PYTHIA, depending on the wave function components for the incoming virtual
photon, various subprocesses are divided into three major classes: the direct
processes, the vector meson dominance (VMD) processes and the anomalous processes~\cite{Friberg:2000ra},
as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:PYTHIAFeyn}. The direct photon interacts as a
point-like particle with the partons of the nucleon, while the VMD and anomalous
components interact through their hadronic structure. The VMD component is
characterized by non-perturbative fluctuations of the photon into a $q\bar{q}$
pair existing long enough to evolve into a hadronic state before the subsequent
interaction with the nucleon ~\cite{Bauer:1977iq}. This process can be described
in the VMD model, where the hadronic state is treated as a vector meson (e.g.
$\rho^0$, $\omega$, $\phi$ ) with the same quantum numbers as the photon. These
VMD states can undergo all the soft/hard interactions with the nucleon allowed
in hadronic physics. The large-scale, perturbatively fluctuated photons can be
added as the anomalous photon part in a Generalized VMD (GVMD) model. Same pQCD
$2\rightarrow2$ process can be developed over the VMD or anomalous state of the
virtual photons on the target nucleon, with the difference that parameterized
photon PDFs are used for anomalous photons whereas for the hard VMD components
those vector meson PDFs are involved. Hard VMD and anomalous process are usually
referred to as ``resolved'' process. Resolved photon processes play a significant
role in the production of hard high-$p_{T}$ processes at $Q^{2}\approx0$. The
following hard subprocesses are grouped in the resolved processes category:
$qq\rightarrow qq, \, q\bar q \rightarrow q \bar q, \, q\bar q\rightarrow gg, \,
qg\rightarrow qg, \, gg\rightarrow q\bar q, gg\rightarrow gg$. In the
high-$Q^{2}$ region, direct processes become dominant, Fig.~\ref{fig:DISgraph}
shows the major subprocesses in that category: LO DIS, Photon-Gluon Fusion (PGF)
and QCD Compton (QCDC). As the PGF process is directly sensitive to the gluon
distribution, it is extremely important for DIS dijet productions.

\end{table}


The full accessible process list and its classification has been summarized in
Tab.~\ref{tab:processList}. Corresponding subprocess ID in PYTHIA can also be found in this table. In the soft process ($91-95$) and LODIS (99)
process, the transverse momentum transfer is very small. They do not contribute
to the high-$p_{T}$ correlated particle pairs. At small $x$, gluon behavior
dominates in the dihadron correlations. Accordingly, we are expecting that the gluon channels are sensitive to the gluon saturation effect. Considering the
saturation physics introduces a suppression to correlation function from \ep\ to
\eA\ as suggested in Eq.~(\ref{fig:dihadron_theory_sud}), the final conditional
yield can be expressed as a superposition from different processes:
\begin{equation} 
C(\Delta\phi)=\Sigma_{i}w_{i}w^{s}_{i}C(\Delta\phi)_{i},
\label{eqn:subprocess} 
\end{equation}
with $w_{i}$ being the statistical weight of every subprocess $i$ involved in
the measurement and $w^{s}_{i}$ is the suppression factor for the subprocess $i$
from \ep\ to \eA\ due to saturation. For the quark channels unaffected by saturation $w^{s}_{i}=1$,
while for the gluon channels, suppression of $C(\Delta\phi)$ at away-side is
expected with $w^{s}_{i}<1$.


As the saturation physics discussed above is mainly about the gluon dynamics, in
order to be able to consistently compare with the theoretical dihadron cross
section in Sec.~\ref{sec:dihadrontheory}, we need to include gluon dijet channels from
PGF and gluon-initiated resolved process in the comparison. However, as the
measured observable in the real experiment is a mixture of different processes, as
illustrated in Eq.~(\ref{eqn:subprocess}), we have to know how significant the
signal from gluon saturation manifests itself in a mixed event sample. From the
saturation-based predictions, a sizeable suppression of the away-side peak from \ep\
to \eA\ is expected.

In the meanwhile, it is crucial to point out that parton showers suppress the
away-side peak of the dihadron correlation function just like saturation does.
However, currently it is still unclear how the parton shower effect is modified
in the nuclear medium, without which it is hard to draw any definite conclusions
about the saturation effects, as parton showers and saturation effects are always
entangled. Nevertheless, thanks to the large kinematic coverage of eRHIC, one
can explore the nuclear dependence of parton showers outside the saturation
region by measuring dihadron correlations for different nuclei in the high
$Q^2$ regime. This kinematic regime has a significant phase space for parton
showers for this observable. More importantly, the measurement of dihadron
correlations gives the opportunity to use the near-side peak of the correlation
function as a reference to study the nuclear medium effects on parton showers as
the saturation effects only manifest themselves in the away-side peak, as shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadron_effects}.

In the saturation formalism, the parton shower contribution is effectively cast
into the Sudakov factor for the DIS dijet process at small $x$. To illustrate this
point, Fig.~\ref{fig:epCompareWithSud} shows the correlation function simulated
with and without parton showers, compared to the corresponding theoretical
predictions with and without Sudakov effects. The filled circles represent the PYTHIA
simulation for \ep\ without parton showers, and they agree very well with the solid
line from the theoretical prediction including saturation effects, but excluding
Sudakov effects. The comparison (empty circles and dashed line) between simulated PYTHIA \ep\
data including parton showers and the theoretical predictions with
saturation plus Sudakov effects is also good, especially considering the model
uncertainties. Thus, the agreement in \ep\ collisions enables one to estimate the
nuclear medium effects on parton showers in the theoretical predictions for
saturation including Sudakov effects.

Since the saturation effect decouples from hadronization, it does not
depend on which specific particle type being detected. Although the theoretical
prediction is made for $\pi^{0}$, the suppression factor from \ep\ to \eA\
still holds for other different final state particles. In the next section, the
significance for the suppression of gluon saturation will be shown for the
charged hadrons $C(\Delta\phi)$ observable with limited statistics and
expected background estimation.

\section{Kinematics reconstruction and event selection}
The kinematic variables of an event are very important for the physics analysis.
Experimentally, the kinematic variables can be reconstructed in several ways.
One of the common ways is to reconstruct from the scattered leptons. In this
method, the scattered lepton must be identified. At eRHIC, for intermediate
$Q^{2}$ values, it is the scattered electron to be found. With the energy
($E^{'}_{e}$), scattering angle ($\theta_{e}$) of this scattered electron and
the incoming electron beam energy ($E_{e}$), one can extract all the kinematic
information for that event. Considering that these variables are actually
correlated, only two variables need to be reconstructed and all the others can
be calculated from these two. Practically, we usually reconstruct the kinematic
variables $Q^{2}$ and $y$ as follows:
\begin{align}
& Q^{2}=2E_{e}E^{'}_{e}(1-cos\theta_{e}), \nonumber \\ 
& y=1-\frac{E^{'}_{e}}{E_{e}}cos^{2}(\theta_{e}/2).
\label{eqn:electr_method}
\end{align}
All the other kinematics variables can be obtained based on these two and
the knowledge of the beam energy. 

When $Q^{2}$ is very large  (electroweak interaction happens), the scattered
lepton can be a neutrino that cannot be captured by our detector system. A
different method, the Jacquet-Blondel (JB) method must be applied. This method
reconstructs event kinematics from all the hadronic final state particles.
\begin{align}
& (E-p_{z})_{h} = \sum_{h}(E_{h}-p_{z}^{h}), \nonumber \\ 
& p_{T,h}^{2} = (\sum_{h}p_{x,h})^{2}+(\sum_{h}p_{y,h})^{2}, \nonumber \\ 
& y_{JB}=\frac{(E-p_{z})_{h}}{2E_{e}}, \nonumber \\ 
& Q_{JB}^{2}=\frac{p_{T,h}^{2}}{1-y_{JB}}.
\end{align}

Other methods for kinematics reconstruction can be found in
Ref.~\cite{Blumlein:2012bf}. In the following studies, we will use electron
method to reconstruct the event kinematics.

%\section{Electron-Ion Collider and Simulations}\label{sec:MC}
%
%\subsection{The Electron-Ion Collider and its Detector}
%
%Two independent designs for an EIC are being developed in the United States:
%eRHIC, at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL); and MEIC/ELIC at Thomas
%Jefferson National Laboratory (JLab). The following studies will focus on the
%eRHIC version of an EIC and the new model detector at eRHIC. The eRHIC design at
%BNL reuses the available infrastructure and facilities of RHIC's high-energy
%polarized proton/ion beam. A new electron beam, based on Energy Recovery LINAC
%(ERL) technology, is to be built inside the current RHIC tunnel. At eRHIC, the
%collision luminosity is expected to be in the order of $10^{33-34}
%\textrm{cm}^{-2}\textrm{s}^{-1}$. The full range of proton/ion beam energies will be accessible
%from the beginning of operations, while the electron beam energy will start with
%$10-15$ GeV and later be increased to $20$ GeV.
%
%The tracking system of the baseline eRHIC detector will consist of a TPC, GEM
%and silicon detectors spanning a range of $-4<\eta<4$ in pseudorapidity. The
%end-cap and barrel region on the detector will be equipped with electromagnetic
%calorimeters covering $-4.5<\eta<4.5$. Hadronic calorimeter will be used mostly
%for jet physics at full energy in the forward (hadron beam going direction) and
%backward (electron beam going direction) rapidities spanning $2<|\eta|<4.5$.
%Projected momentum and energy resolutions of these devices are better than a few
%percent, which extends the capability of this detector to a large variety of
%physics topics.



The present study is based on the planned lepton and nucleon beam energy of 10
GeV $\times$ 100 GeV and 20 GeV $\times$ 100 GeV. Larger center of mass energy probes deeper into the saturation regime. The kinematics are constrained
to the main region of interest for dihadron correlation studies,
$1\, \textrm{GeV}^{2}<Q^{2}<20 \, \textrm{GeV}^{2}$ and
$0.01<y<0.95$.

As observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:scattered_electron}, in the kinematics region we are interested in,
backward electromagnetic calorimetry and the tracking system will be utilized for
reconstruction of the event kinematics (based on the electron method). As shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Q2VsxBj}, abundant high-\pt particles will be generated in the
specified kinematic region to make correlated hadron pairs even with a limited
luminosity of 1 fb$^{-1}$. Among those generated high-\pt particles,
Fig.~\ref{fig:PtSpectrum} suggests that gluon dijet processes dominate in the
production of particles with a transverse momentum greater than 2 GeV/$c$ and
charged pions are the major component for the final state particles.

The event selections are targeting to extract the most prospective kinematics
region sensitive to the physics message we are looking for and also validates
the requirement of our theoretical calculations. In order to guarantee the
validity of perturbative calculations and avoid the kinematic regime of
quasi-real photo-production, a cut of $Q^{2}>1 \, \mathrm{GeV}^{2}$ is generally
made. On the other hand, probing the saturation dynamics requires to probe the
dense region, which means that one needs to go to low $x$ and low-to-moderate
$Q^{2}$ in the pursuit of saturation effects at a certain center of mass energy.
A cut in transverse momentum of the charged hadron pairs is usually performed to
pick particles from hard interactions. A cut on $z_{h}$ is also imposed to
reject particles from the target remnants.
Choice on the cut of trigger particle should not be too large $p_{T}$ and $z_{h}$ is
better to be intermediate. Thus, a typical cut to select dihadron pairs from hard parton
scatterings is: $p_{T}^{trig}>2$ GeV/$c$, $1 \, \mathrm{GeV/}c
<p_{T}^{assoc}<p_{T}^{trig}, 0.2<z_{h}^{trig},z_{h}^{assoc}<0.4$.

The hadron pair selection iteration loops as: first, test if the current event is in
our selected $Q^{2}$-$x_{Bj}$ bin; second, choose the particle with the highest
$p_{T}$ in that event as the trigger particle which passes the trigger particle cut criteria;
after that, the particles which satisfy the associate cut criteria will be identified
as the associate. By pairing the trigger particle with every associate particle, we can
make the conditional yield $C(\Delta\phi)=\frac{N_{pair}(\Delta\phi)}{N_{trig}}$.

\section{Monte Carlo results and uncertainties} 
 To further explore the
transition behavior in and out of the saturation region, we use three $Q^{2}$ bins:
$1\, \textrm{GeV}^{2}<Q^{2}<2 \, \mathrm{GeV}^{2}$, $3\, \textrm{GeV}^{2}<Q^{2}<5 \,
\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$ and $9\, \textrm{GeV}^{2}<Q^{2}<20 \, \mathrm{GeV}^{2}$; and two $y$ bins:
$0.25<y<0.35$ and $0.6<y<0.8$. To study saturation physics using varying heavy
ion beams, we focus on the $1\, \textrm{GeV}^{2}<Q^{2}<2 \, \mathrm{GeV}^{2}$, $0.6<y<0.8$
bin, while the $9\, \textrm{GeV}^{2}<Q^{2}<20 \, \mathrm{GeV}^{2}$ or $0.25<y<0.35$ bins serve
as a reference for the behaviour without saturation effects. To pin down the
nuclear dependence of parton showers, we compare the correlation between \ep\
and \eA\ collisions for bins without saturation effects.

broad correlation between these two variables is observed. }
\label{fig:xbjVsxg}
\end{figure}
Because the saturation scale $Q_{s}$ varies with the gluon momentum fraction
$x_{g}$, it is important to have access to $x_{g}$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:xbjVsxg} shows how, by utilizing $x_{Bj}$ which can be determined experimentally, one can
effectively constrain the underlying $x_{g}$ distribution. Although this is only
a broad correlation, it is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:xgCover} that
the typical $x_{g}$ at a given $x_{Bj}$ is constrained to a certain magnitude and can be used to
separate the saturation region from the non-saturated region.

the detector.

\label{fig:dihadronMulti} 
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadronMulti} shows the conditional yield function in various
kinematics bins, from which we can read about the interplay of
underlying kinematics and the cut preference. The relative near-side away-side
peak yield changes with $y$ due to the selection of trigger $p_{T}$ cut. At
lower $y$, the center of mass energy at hard interaction is smaller. After taken
out a trigger particle, the near-side jet energy is not enough to produce
another particle fits into the associate, which aggregates most of the associate
particle at away-side peak. As to the evolution in $Q^{2}$, two factors play a
significant role. Higher $Q^{2}$ produces harder jet $p_{T}$ spectrum. Also
parton shower becomes stronger in high $Q^{2}$ enhancing the yield of particles.
However, it is still unknown how parton shower is going to be changed in the nuclear
medium. Here, we just assume that it is the same. But more systematic
studies can be done when the real data come.


As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadron_theory_sud}, if we are in a kinematic regime
in $x$ and $Q^2$ where saturation effects are to be expected, the dihadron
correlation function should exhibit a noticeable suppression of the away-side
peak. The most promising kinematics bin to study this saturation signature at an
EIC is $1\, \textrm{GeV}^{2}<Q^{2}<2 \, \mathrm{GeV}^{2}$ and $0.6<y<0.8$.

$Q_{s}^{2}$ by a factor of 0.5 and 2. Sudakov resummation has also been incorporated
for \eAu. The solid lines represent a fit for the simulated pseudo-data
including detector effects; the dashed line excludes detector effects.}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:correUncertainSud} we compare the strength of the
coincidence probability based on a theoretical saturation model prediction for
the away-side for \ep\ and $e+$Au. The filled circles in
Fig.~\ref{fig:correUncertainSud} are simulated with PYTHIA
for \ep\ collisions, including detector smearing and acceptance effects.
The projected $e+$Au saturated correlation function (open circles) is
obtained by multiplying the \ep\ histogram with the suppression factor
$w^{s}_{i}=C(\Delta\phi)_{eAu}/C(\Delta\phi)_{ep}$ including Sudakov effects extracted
from Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadron_theory_sud}. This suppression factor can only be applied to
dijet channels involving gluons; namely PGF and resolved $qg\rightarrow qg$,
$gg\rightarrow gg$, $gg\rightarrow q\bar q$ subprocesses. The other quark
initiated subprocesses have been simulated with PYTHIA using the non-saturated
\eA\ model including nuclear PDFs and final-state energy loss. The uncertainties
represent the statistical precision from an integrated luminosity of 1
fb$^{-1}$. The solid (dashed) lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:correUncertainSud} represent
fits to the simulated data points with (without) detector effects included in
the simulation.

Since to date there is no exact knowledge of the saturation scale, the
uncertainty in the suppression factor is estimated by varying the saturation
scale by a factor of 0.5 and 2. The resulting uncertainty bands are depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:correUncertainSud}. The suppression of the away-side peak remains
significant even with this additional uncertainty compared to the $e+$Au curve
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dihadron_base} accounting for nuclear effects in the
parton distribution functions, energy loss effects and the resonance decay. In
summary, the suppression effects on dihadron correlations due to saturation can
be clearly discriminated from effects based on classical nuclear medium
modifications with a well-designed EIC machine.


\section{Summary}\label{sec:dihadronsummary}

Through detailed analysis, we have shown the capability of a proposed EIC
to perform dihadron correlation measurements. It
is proven that the acceptance of the dedicated detector is wide enough to
collect all the trigger particles as well as the associated particles used in our
studies. Moreover, the onset of the projected saturation region is well covered by
the eRHIC energy regime. It will clearly be possible to do a high
precision measurement of the correlation function for dihadron production with
different nuclear beams at the proposed EIC.

In this study we also describe how this dihadron correlation function is
calculated in a saturation/CGC formalism, and provide predictions for this
measurement with or without saturation effects taken into consideration. It is
straightforward to see that a strong suppression of the away-side peak of the
correlation function is expected from saturation effects, and detector effects are
negligible on this observable. Suppression effects due to leading-twist
shadowing are significantly smaller. Therefore, the observation of such
a suppression in the dihadron correlation function measured at an EIC will be a
strong experimental evidence for the existence of gluon saturation.

Dihadron measurements at an EIC are also vital and intriguing in
that they will directly measure for the first time the behavior of the Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams
gluon distribution, about which we still know very little, and which we
can hardly extract from other measurements. The knowledge of how parton showers
behave in a nuclear medium is indispensable in obtaining a valid conclusion for the
above discussions. With the Sudakov resummation performed in the saturation
formalism, this nuclear modification of parton showers in DIS dijet process is
found to be very small at leading order. Nevertheless, there might be some
nuclear dependence in the Sudakov factor at higher orders or in the
non-perturbative part~\cite{Kang:2012am}. An EIC will also permit unique measurements
that will give a definite answer to this question. With the wide kinematic
reach and different nuclear beams, an EIC is capable of measuring the $A$
dependence of parton showers. This would require quantitative measurements of
the modification of the near-side peak of the correlation functions in a 
nucleus environment and in kinematic regions where parton showers dominate.

In conclusion, the proposed high-luminosity, high-energy electron-ion collider,
together with the designed detector, can provide an ideal apparatus to study
gluon saturation with high precision through the measurement of 
the dihadron correlation function.
